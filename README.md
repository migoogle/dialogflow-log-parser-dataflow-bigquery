# Dialogflow Log Parser

This repository contains an example of how to leverage Cloud Dataflow and BigQuery to view Dialogflow interactions.

The Pipeline Steps are as follows:

1. Dialogflow Interactions are logged to Google Cloud Logging
2. A Cloud Logging sink sends the log messages to Cloud Pub/Sub
3. Dataflow process the __textpayload__ and streams it to BigQuery
4. Access to the log interactions are now available in BigQuery

__Note:__ Dialogflow Interactions Logging is sent to Cloud Logging as a Text Payload, this code will parse the Text Payload to a structured format within BigQuery which is defined in the Dataflow code.

## BigQuery Schema

You can modify the schema.json file to define the BigQuery's table schema.
This json is an example for fields extracted from the logs of a Dialogflow CX agent:

```json
[
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "project_id",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "location_id",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "TargetPage",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "session_id",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "intentDetectionConfidence",
        "type": "FLOAT"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "agent_id",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "responseId",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "receiveTimestamp",
        "type": "TIMESTAMP"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "matchType",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "error_type",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "string_value",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "jsonPayload",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "parameters",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "currentPage",
        "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
        "mode": "NULLABLE",
        "name": "timestamp",
        "type": "TIMESTAMP"
    }
]
```

## Installation

1. Enable the Dataflow API

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable dataflow
    ```

2. Create a Storage Bucket for Dataflow Staging

    ```sh
    gsutil mb gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
    ```

3. Create a folder in the newly created bucket in the Google Cloud Console Storage Browser called __tmp__

4. Create a Pub/Sub Topic

    ```sh
    gcloud pubsub topics create [TOPIC_NAME]
    ``` 

5. Create a Cloud Logging sink

    ```sh
    gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_NAME] --log-filter="resource.type=global"
    ```
    
Once the sink was created, you need to add the service account associated to the pub/sub topic (touch 3 dots option). The assigned role should be "Pub/Sub Publisher"

6. Install the Apache Beam GCP Library

    ```sh
    python3 -m virtualenv tempenv
    source tempenv/bin/activate
    pip install apache-beam[gcp]
    ```

7. Create BigQuery dataset and table

    If you're creating an empty table, use the bq mk command.
    [For more info about bq mk command press here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/schemas#creating_a_json_schema_file)

   ```sh
    bq mk --table project_id:dataset.table [YOUR_BIGQUERY_SCHEMA_JSON_FILE]
    ```

8. Deploy Dataflow Job.
    [For more info about runing a pipeline on a Dataflow service press here](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/quickstarts/create-pipeline-python#run-the-pipeline-on-the-dataflow-service)

    ```sh
    python3 stackdriverdataflowbigquery.py.py --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \ 
    --input_topic=projects/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/topics/[YOUR_TOPIC_NAME] \ 
    --runner=DataflowRunner --temp_location=gs://[YOUR_DATAFLOW_STAGING_BUCKET]/tmp \
    --output_bigquery=[YOUR_BIGQUERY_DATASET.YOUR BIGQUERY_TABLE] --region=us-central1 \
    --bigquery_schema=[YOUR_BIGQUERY_SCHEMA_JSON_FILE]
    ```

9. Enable Dialogflow Logs to Cloud Logging

    Enable Log interactions to Dialogflow and Google Cloud Logging.

Once you enable Enable Log interactions, your new Dialogflow interactions will be available in BigQuery
